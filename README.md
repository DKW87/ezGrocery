# ezGrocery
An Android app for ez grocery list management!

What can it do:

- natively supports dark/light mode;
- persistent item order and rearrangement;
- collapse/expand active/completed items;
- no annoying notifications, banners, ads or popups;
- always works offline and stores data locally!

  What is to come:
- multiple, recurring and sectioned lists;
- jump to last opened list when opening the app;
- list navigation screen;
- settings screen with initial customization;
- more customization options;
- ghost items (items you don't want returned in your list next time);
- synchronize lists to your Google Drive.

And more to come!
