# ezGrocery
An Android app for ez grocery list management.

What is to come:
- multiple, recurring and sectioned lists;
- persistent item order and rearrangement;
- ghost items (items you don't want returned in your list next time);
- jump to last opened list when opening the app;
- synchronize your lists to your Google Drive;
- always works offline (already true!);
- no annoying notifications, banners, ads or popups;
- smooth, clean, minimal GUI with relatively large item cards;
- large cards will allow for ez completion when at the grocery store!

  And more to come!
